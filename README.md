Implements the required database functions:

- `insertItem(Book book)` - Add a book to favorites
- `getItems()` - Retrieve all favorite books
- `deleteItem(String id)` - Remove a book from favorites
- Additional utility methods for checking favorites and database management

### 3. API Service (`lib/services/api_service.dart`)

- `searchBooks(String query)` - Search books using Google Books API
- Handles HTTP requests and JSON response parsing
- Error handling for network issues

### 4. User Interface

#### Home Screen (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)

- Search bar for entering book queries
- FutureBuilder for asynchronous API calls
- ListView displaying search results
- Favorite button for each book (filled/empty based on status)
- Navigation to favorites screen

#### Favorites Screen (`lib/screens/favorites_screen.dart`)

- ListView/GridView displaying saved favorite books
- Delete functionality for removing books
- Book details dialog
- Clear all favorites option

- Provides loading states and error handling
- Ensures smooth user experience during data operations

### Error Handling

- Network error handling for API calls
- Database error handling with user feedback
- Graceful fallbacks for missing book images
